## Parser/Scanner stage
Here we include how to go through inputted tokens and split them apart according
to our language documentation.
The AST file is not in its final form. 

However, in order to test this stage of our project, other than getting the whole thing to compile with OCaml, we implemented a pretty print function that would allow us to visualize the abstract syntax tree "created" by the parser so that we can check for any inconsistencies at this stage.
