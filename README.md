## Team Members and Roles:
- Nikhil (Language Guru)
- Alex (Project Manager)

- Pedro (Tester)

## Hello World Stage
At this point, we have decided to limit our program to printing integers and strings. 
Return statements are also included.

## Developments:
Since the last milestone, we have: 
- Implemented reduced versions of lexer through to top-level using MicroC as a reference guide to structure.
- Left structures in place (commented) to iteratively add more features.
- Added Continuous integration for testing through CircleCI integration.
- Started regression and (semi)unit test suites

## Hello World:
The hello world program (or first Prime program) prints the integer 0. Files for compiling and running test_hello are included in /tests.
